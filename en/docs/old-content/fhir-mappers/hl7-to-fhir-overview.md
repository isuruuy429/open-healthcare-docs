# Overview

HL7 V2 is a widely adopted messaging standard used before FHIR to support clinical data exchange between systems. WSO2 Healthcare Solution Server is capable of receiving and sending HL7 messages. 

WSO2 Healthcare Solution provides a dedicated datamapper called V2-To-FHIR datamapper. V2-To-FHIR datamapper provides capability to convert HL7 v2 messages into FHIR resources. The mappings between the hl7 v2 message elements are referred from the [V2-To-FHIR implementation guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/v2-to-fhir/branches/master/index.html) published by HL7.  Therefore this datamapper constructs a FHIR bundle with the resources created from the prebuilt mappings for segments and data types as per the specification.
