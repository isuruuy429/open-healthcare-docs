# FHIR R4 Metadata Service

## Introduction
This service provides implementation of FHIR Metadata API. This implements 
[capabilities](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#capabilities) interaction, which is used to retrieve capability 
statement describing the server's current operational functionality by FHIR client applications. 

This FHIR server interaction returns Capability Statement ([CapabilityStatement](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CapabilityStatement) 
FHIR resource) that specifies which resource types and interactions are supported by the FHIR server

!!! note
        Supported FHIR version is 4.0.1.

    ## Setup and run locally

    1. Clone the [source code](https://github.com/wso2/open-healthcare-prebuilt-services/tree/main/conformance/metadata-fhirr4-service) repository to your local machine and navigate to the pre-built service on metadata-fhirr4-service.

    2. Configure the Config.toml with relevant configurations mentioned in [Configurations](#configurations).

        Also, resource details need to be added as described in [Configurations](#resources).

    3. Run the project.

        ```ballerina
        bal run
        ```

    4. Invoke the API.

        Sample request for FHIR Capability Statement:

        ```
        curl 'http://<host>:<port>/fhir/r4/metadata'
        ```

    ## [Optional] Deploy in Choreo

    !!! note

            This can be deployed as a standalone microservice in an on-premise environment or any other cloud solution. Optionally, you can use WSO2's cloud solution, Choreo, to deploy.
            

    WSO2’s [Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/) is an internal developer platform that redefines how you create digital experiences. Choreo empowers you to seamlessly design, develop, deploy, and govern your cloud native applications, unlocking innovation while reducing time-to-market. You can deploy the healthcare prebuilt services in Choreo as explained below. 

    ### Prerequisites

    If you are signing in to the Choreo Console for the first time, create an organization as follows:

    1. Go to [Choreo console](https://console.choreo.dev/), and sign in using your preferred method.
    2. Enter a unique [organization](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/#:~:text=An%20organization%20in%20Choreo%20is,when%20signing%20in%20to%20Choreo.) name. For example, Stark Industries.
    3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.
    4. Click Create.
    This creates the organization and opens the Project Home page of the default project created for you.

    ### Steps to Deploy Metadata Prebuilt Service in Choreo
    1. Create Service Component
        * Fork the pre-built Ballerina services [repository](https://github.com/wso2/open-healthcare-prebuilt-services) to your Github organization.
        * Create a service component pointing to the `metadata-fhirr4-service`. Follow the [official documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-ballerina-rest-api/#step-1-create-a-service-component) of Choreo to create and configure a service:.
        * Once the component creation is complete, you will see the component overview page.

    2. Configure and Deploy

        * Follow the [official documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-ballerina-rest-api/#step-2-build-and-deploy) to deploy the Metadata prebuilt service to your organization.

        * FHIR Resource details need to be added as described in [Configurations/Resources](#resources).

        * On deployment, configurables mentioned in [Configurations/Configs](#configurations) needs to be configured in Choreo configurable editor.

    ### Resources

    FHIR resource details need to be added in `/resources/fhir_resources.json`. A sample `fhir_resources.json` consisting of
    `Patient` resource details, is as below.

    ```
    [
        {

            "versioning": "versioned",
            "conditionalCreate": false,
            "conditionalRead": "not-supported",
            "conditionalUpdate": false,
            "conditionalDelete": "not-supported",

    ]    
    ```

    When deploying on Choreo, Choreo's [File Mount](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#apply-a-file-mount-to-your-container) can be used to mount the `fhir_resources.json`. The Mount Path should be provided as,

    ```
    /resources/fhir_resources.json

    ```


    # FHIR R4 SMART Configuration Service

    ## Introduction

    This service provides API implementation of 
    [SMART Configuration API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#discovery-of-server-capabilities-and-configuration) 
    of a FHIR server.

    SMART defines a discovery document available at `.well-known/smart-configuration` relative to a FHIR Server Base URL, 
    allowing clients to learn the authorization endpoint URLs and features a server supports. This information helps clients to 
    direct authorization requests to the right endpoint, and helps clients construct an authorization request that the server 
    can support.

    ```Supported FHIR version is 4.0.1.```

    ## Setup and run

    1. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the pre-built service on smart-config-fhirr4-service.

    2. Configure the Config.toml with relevant configurations mentioned in [Configurations](#configurations).

    3. Run the project.

        ```ballerina
        bal run
        ```

    4. Invoke the API.

        Sample request for FHIR Capability Statement:

        ```
        curl 'http://<host>:<port>/.well-known/smart-configuration'
        ```
